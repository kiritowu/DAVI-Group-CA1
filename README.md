# K12 Education in the US Analysis with Tableau

## Introduction
This repo consists of the files that our group from DAAA/FT/1B/01 (2020) submitted for our Data Visualisation assignment.

## Files

### K12 Education in the US-1.twbx 
- A Tableau workbook file which contains our data visualisations.
### cleaning_flow.tfl
- A Tableau Prep Builder Flow file which was used to perform initial data cleansing.
### pivot.py
- A Python script used to transform our data to a format more useful for data analysis using Tableau. Data manipulation was done using the Pandas library.
### states_all_transformed.csv 
- The transformed data produced by pivot.py, which was then later joined with the cleaned data in Tableau.
### states_all_extended_cleaned.csv
- Cleaned non-transformed dataset.
### nationalAverageNAEP.csv
- Dataset containing the national average NAEP scores. This data was accidently removed from the original dataset, and hence was re-added in this csv file.
